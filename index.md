## Welcome to my site!

I make a lot of different things. Some are for fun, others are just to mess around. I make stuff like Archives, trolls, and even a mini github puzzle! IF you want to see my page, visit [my site here.](https://github.com/3L33tmakersUnited) See ya 'round the web!

### What I do and make

I'm all over the place! I do many things other than Github too. Some other things you may know me famous for are:

```markdown

- Gaming. You will see me under many usernames but most famous of all: Helloperson of Junon.io!If you played the game
  , say hi to me, you may know me for being in: (former Amionto city), IJA Base Defence, and more!

- I also do Scratch under the same username. Here is a link [click here](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/3L33tmakersUnited/) 

```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/3L33tmakersUnited/3L33tmakersUnited.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
